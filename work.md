<h2>T-Mobile</h2>
<h4>Information Security Software Development Intern</h4>
At T-Mobile, I worked with the Information Security team helping protect T-Mobile's data.

We were responsible for improving the encryption delivery system. I had the chance to work with technologies like Teradata, Hadoop, and HPE Voltage.

One of the projects I was responsible for was creating a report of unclassified table columns in Hadoop and Teradata. The report I generated found over 200,000 columns that needed classification for encryption.


<h2>Liberty Mutual Insurance</h2>
<h4>DevOps Intern</h4>
At Liberty Mutual, I worked on a DevOps team who provided self-service tools for test data management.

I had the opportunity to assist in upgrading a Java Selenium testing framework to the new Java 8. During the upgrade, we saw that the new drivers caused many issues in the framework. I was responsible for testing and providing a fix for those issues. 

I also had the chance to work with Talend Open Studio to create unit tests for the microservices other members of my team created.

<h2>Voicebox Technologies</h2>
<h4>Software Development Intern</h4>
At Voicebox Technologies, I had the opportunity to work with the Developer Experience team on a developer portal website and a REST API gateway.

During my first Summer at Voicebox, I learned to work with Node.js, use the AngularJS framework, and create end-to-end tests with PhantomJS and Mocha. One of the features I developed for the website was a voice recorder. The recorder would allow the user to capture their voice via a computer's microphone. Once done talking, the recording would be sent to the server to return back a text of their utterance. This was one of the main features of the developer portal so offering a good user experience was important. To provide a satisfactory experience, I modified the recorder to allow silence detection. This required research and implementations of different algorithms.

In my second year at Voicebox, I continued working on the developer portal. While doing so, I was also assigned to create a project that was to be showcased on the developer portal. After learning about the Internet of Things, I decided to create a smart mirror. What I named, Mirror Mirror, was a mirror that users can control using their voice. Mirror Mirror was connected to a variety of services: Forecast.io, Google Maps, Spotify, Pushbullet, and more. In addition to the project, I also worked on improving the WebSocket server for streaming audio.
